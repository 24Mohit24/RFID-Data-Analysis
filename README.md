# RFID Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The RFID Data Analysis project focuses on the in-depth analysis of RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) data to extract valuable insights and patterns. This project employs data analytics techniques, statistical methods, and visualization tools to provide a comprehensive understanding of the movements and behaviors of tracked objects within RFID-enabled systems.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Conduct thorough exploration of RFID data sets to identify relevant variables and patterns.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Implement statistical methods to analyze the distribution, variability, and relationships within the RFID data.

- **Visualization:** Utilize visualization tools to present meaningful insights and trends for easy interpretation.

## Requirements

- Python (for analysis scripts)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Folder containing RFID data sets for analysis.

- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data analysis, statistical methods, and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RFID-Data-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd RFID-Data-Analysis
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the analysis scripts:

   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_data.py
   ```

   Note: Make sure to replace `analyze_data.py` with the actual name of your analysis script.

## Results and Insights

The results of the RFID data analysis will be presented in the `results/` directory, providing insights into the tracked objects' movements, patterns, and behaviors.
